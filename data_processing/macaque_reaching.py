Data processing methods for the macaque reaching data.

Originally processed by Gosztolai et al. 2025 ("MARBLE"): "recorded at 20ms sampling and smoothed at 100ms Gaussian filter"
 - URL: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6969883&version=12.0
 - Note that the spike data ('rate_data_20ms_100ms.pkl') has 60 time points, but the kinematics data ('kinematics.pkl') has 35 time points (60 - GO_CUE of 25 = 700ms/20ms).

IMPORTANT!
 - Days 32-43 have 'None' ("Down" condition) in the `kinematics` data
 - However, the processed `spike_data` excludes this condition, so there are only spike trains for 7 conditions, not 8

The spike_data ("rate_data_20ms_100ms.pkl") contains arrays (separated by day, but stacked by condition within days) of trial spike trains. Each trial is a row, of shape (n_neurons, n_timepoints) = (24, 60). This represents the following preprocessing steps already applied:
 - Smoothing with a 100ms Gaussian filter
 - Subsampling to 20ms intervals

The methods in this file follow this pipeline (per day):
(1) Global data denoising
    (a) Slice the spike data from GO_CUE (or GO_CUE + CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE if CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE > 0) to end. Kinematics data (already pre-sliced to GO_CUE=25, giving 35 timepoints) are further sliced by CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE if CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE > 0.
    (b) Nonlinear: Apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to each trial's neural trajectory if SAVGOL_FILTER_KWARGS is not None ().
    (b) Linear: Optional PCA: Skip PCA if GLOBAL_PCA_REDUCED_DIM is None or >= 24, or GLOBAL_PCA_VARIANCE_RETAINED is None or == 1.0. Otherwise, PCA is enabled. When enabled, fit PCA per day on all trials for that day in 'transductive' mode; in 'inductive' mode, fit only on the train trajectories. If GLOBAL_PCA_VARIANCE_RETAINED is in (0,1), set the number of components to retain that variance; otherwise use GLOBAL_PCA_REDUCED_DIM.
(2) Transform and construct graphs: 
    (a) Use the (optionally PCA-reduced) neural state x[t] after filtering and slicing (GO_CUE + CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE) to build daily spatial CkNN graphs and compute O-frames. 
    (b) For trajectory path graphs, use neural velocity vectors v[t] = x[t+1] - x[t] assigned to time t as vector node features. Node targets use the kinematics (positions and velocities) sliced to match the spike data and truncated to the node count (since the last time point will not have a velocity vector associated with it).

Conceptually, this pipeline 
(1) Slices the neural state data from GO_CUE (or GO_CUE + CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE if CUT_T_AFTER_GO_CUE > 0), globally denoises the data to a new ambient dimension D, then collects all time points from all trials (regardless of condition) onto an assumed 'neural state' manifold (that is, a CkNN graph scaffold of a manifold), with an assumed intrinsic dimension d < D.
(2) Numerically differentiates the neural state data (of dimension D) at each time point to get 'neural velocity' vectors, also of dimension D. 
    - As a convention, even though this is the instantaneous velocity for time t + 0.5, the velocity vectors are assigned to time the prior time point t. That is, v[t] = x[t+1] - x[t]. As a result, we drop the last time point from the neural state data.
(3) Performs a local SVD at each node to learn the local tangent space (i.e., get a basis for it from singular vectors) based on local curvature, and construct the O-frames (with a sign-flipping trick for aligning neighboring nodes' singular vectors) that can project node features from D to d. 
    - Specifically, O_i is comprised of singular vectors from the local SVD at node i. Each O_i \in R^{D \times d}. 
    - The manifold intrinsic dimension d can be hardcoded, or determined by the rounded mean participation ratio / spectral entropy of the singular values from each local SVD.
(4) Each v[t] \in R^D is associated with a point/node i, and is next projected into the point's d-dimensional local tangent space using the O-frames from (3), to get the 'tangent neural velocity' vector as the node feature. 
    - Formally, v^{\text{tangent}}[t] = O_i[:, :d]^T v[t], where v^{\text{tangent}}[t] is the tangent neural velocity vector at node i for time t.
    - Note that this means we 'differentiate then project'. If instead we projected each x[t] into its local tangent space before we differentiated/subtracted, this would incorrectly mix different tangent spaces, that is, fail to align in tangent space first, since x[t+1] has a different tangent space than x[t]. In other words, we need to measure global displacement first, before expressing it in local frames of reference, which can vary by rotations and translations. Think of trying to measure the displacement of a plane flying from New York to Melbourne in local 2-d coordinates.
(5) Each block of the Q diffusion operator matrix (used to diffuse the tangent vector node features across local frames) is constructed based on GEOMETRIC_MODE:
    - 'equivariant': Q[i,j] = O_i @ O_j.T (requires D=d, i.e., O_i \in R^{d x d})
        Preserves SO(d) equivariance of tangent space vectors.
        Use when the manifold dimension d equals the ambient dimension D globally.
    - 'invariant': Q[i,j] = O_i[:, :d].T @ O_j[:, :d] (allows D>d, i.e., O_i \in R^{D x d})
        Projects to intrinsic space, gaining SO(D) invariance but losing ambient equivariance.
        Use when the manifold has intrinsic dimension d < ambient dimension D.
    Hence Q \in R^{Nd x Nd}. Using Q[i,j], we can diffuse v_i with v_j (both in R^d), since Q[i,j] transports v_j into node i's local frame.

By taking their ratio, the formula penalizes uneven distributions. The denominator's sensitivity to large values causes the overall ratio to decrease when the variance is concentrated in a few components, and to increase when it is spread out.

    - Builds one spatial CkNN graph per included day from lever positions across all trials/timepoints (aligned with diffed spike nodes).
    - Splits remain at trajectory level (train/val/test) and are stored as node masks.
    - Days are processed serially, but within each day per-node SVD computation is parallelized via `num_workers` and `backend`.

    Node-trial mapping (per returned day graph):
    - node_trial_id: Long tensor (N,) mapping each node to its trial id.
    - node_trial_time_idx: Long tensor (N,) time index within its trial after GO_CUE/diff alignment.
    - node_condition_idx: Long tensor (N,) condition index per `CONDITIONS` (or -1 if unknown).
    - trial_ids: Long tensor (T,) unique trial ids for the day.
    - trial_ptr: Long tensor (T+1,) CSR-style pointers; nodes for trial j are in [trial_ptr[j], trial_ptr[j+1]).
    - trial_split: Long tensor (T,) values {0=train, 1=val, 2=test} per trajectory.

    4. Build spatial CkNN graph over all neural state nodes
